# Chocolate Walnut Cookies

Crunchy. A recipe from [Julia Ostro](http://www.julia-ostro.com/blog/2017/12/2/chocolate-walnut-cooki)

Makes ~24 cookies

## Ingredients
- 200g unsalted butter, softened
- 100g caster sugar
- 100g brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 250g plain flour
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- pinch of sea salt, plus extra for serving
- 150g 70% dark chocolate, roughly chopped
- 80g walnuts, roughly chopped

## Steps

In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugars until pale and very fluffy. Add in the egg and vanilla and mix well. Stir through the flour, baking powder and salt and gently combine until everything is well incorporated but being careful not to over-mix. Now add in the dark chocolate and walnuts and combine. Cover the bowl and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour. 

Preheat an oven to 180C and line four trays with baking paper. 

Place heaped tablespoons of the dough onto the trays, leaving room for them to spread. If you only have one or two trays, keep the dough in the fridge while each batch is cooking and then repeat the process once you have a free tray. 

Bake in the preheated oven for 12-14 minutes or until lightly golden. Allow to cool before transferring from the trays. Serve with cold milk and extra sea salt.
