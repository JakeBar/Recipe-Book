# Vietnamese Spring Rolls with Firm Tofu

Vegan friendly dish. Can be made in advance.

Serves loads of peeps.

## Ingredients

### Rolls
- 60g rice vermicelli or rice noodles
- 8 rice paper wrappers
- Organic very firm tofu, fried (simply better foods)
* 1 1/3 tablespoons chopped fresh Thai basil
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves
* 3 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander leaves
- 2 lettuce leaves, chopped
- Red cabbage
- carrot

### Sauce
- Kewpie Siracha Mayo

### Peanut Dipping Sauce (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped roasted peanuts
- 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce

## Steps

1. Pat down the firm tofu with paper towels, then leave under a large book or object for 5 minutes.
2. Cut the tofu into thin pieces about 4cm in length and 2cm wide.
3. Fry the tofu on medium to high heat and set aside.
4. Bring a medium saucepan of water to the boil. Boil rice noodles for 3 to 5 minutes, or until al dente, and drain. Rinse thoroughly with cold water so they don't stick together.
5. Fill a large shallow bowl with warm water. Dip one wrapper into the water for 1 second to soften. Lay wrapper on the bench and place a piece of firm tofu, a handful of noodles, basil, mint, coriander and lettuce in a row across the centre, leaving about 5cm of the wrapper uncovered on each side.
6. Fold in uncovered sides of wrapper, then tightly roll to enclose the filling. Repeat with remaining rolls.
7. Serve the rice paper rolls with the kewpie siracha mayo or hoisin-peanut dipping sauces.
