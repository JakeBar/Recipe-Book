# Korean Dumplings (Mandu)

Different from your reg Chinese dumpling.

Makes 30 dumplings

## Ingredients

- 25 - 30 dumpling wrappers, slightly thick

### Filling
 1 cup packed finely chopped kimchi
- 170g firm tofu
- 250g bean sprouts
- 1/2 medium onion
- 3 scallions
- 100g ground pork or beef
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon finely grated ginger or juiced
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1/2 egg, use the other half to seal the wrappers
- salt to taste (1/4 teaspoon)
- 1 pinch pepper

### Dipping Sauce
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon vinegar
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes (gochugaru)

## Steps

1. Finely chop the kimchi and squeeze out as much liquid as possible by hand. Squeeze out water from tofu.

2. Place tofu under a heavy object such as cutting board to press out water first and then squeeze by hand. Also, using a cheesecloth will make squeezing easier. Blanch the bean sprouts in boiling water, drain, chop and squeeze out water. Finely chop the onion and squeeze out water. Finely chop the scallions.

3. The squeezed ingredients should be dry and crumbly. Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix well by hand.

4. Place one heaping teaspoonful to a tablespoon of the filling on a wrapper. Wet the edges of the wrapper with water or egg wash and seal tightly (pushing the air out with your fingers) into a half-moon shape. (Stop here if you want a half-moon shaped dumplings that you can fry instead of steaming.) Then, bring the two ends together, moist the overlapping side with water or egg wash, and press tightly together to create a round shape. Repeat this process until all the filling/wrappers are used.

5. Kimchi mandu can be steamed for about 8 minutes in a steamer (10 minutes if frozen). Make sure to line the steamer with a cheesecloth or paper towel to prevent mandu from sticking.

> Tips for freezing: Mandu is usually made in large quantities, so freeze them for a quick snack or meal in the future. Freeze the dumplings on a tray with no pieces touching for about an hour, and then store them in a freezer bag. Otherwise, the skins will get soggy from the moisture in the filling and stick together in the freezing process.

6. To make the Dipping Sauce, combine all the ingredients together. Serve the mandu with the sauce.
