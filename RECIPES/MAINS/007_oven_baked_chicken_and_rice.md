# Oven Baked Chicken and Rice

## Ingredients

### Chicken

- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 teaspoons dried parsley
- 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper to taste
- 6 skinless chicken thighs, bone in or out

### Rice

- 1 large onion chopped
- 4 cloves garlic minced
- 2 tablespoons oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper
- 2 cups chicken broth (or stock)
- 1 1/2 cups hot water
- 2 cups long grain white rice

### Mushrooms

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 14 ounces (400g) button mushrooms quartered
- 1/4 cup chives, divided
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley, to garnish

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. In a shallow bowl, mix together the olive oil, sugar, oregano, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, salt and pepper. Add the chicken and coat each piece evenly with the seasoning. Set aside, allowing the flavours to absorb into the meat. If time allows, marinade overnight for a deeper flavour.
3. Spray a large baking dish (10-inch x 15-inch OR 25 x 35 cm) with nonstick cooking oil spray. Add the onion, garlic, oil, salt, pepper, **HOT** boiled broth, hot water and butter into the dish. Mix well to melt the butter and combine. Stir in the rice.
4. Arrange thighs in the dish over the rice, cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover, spray chicken with oil and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked right through to the bone and rice is soft. Change oven setting to broil to brown the chicken and crisp rice (only needs 3-5 minutes).
5. Remove chicken thighs, mix the rice through, then arrange the chicken back on top of the rice. Cover and allow it to rest for 10 minutes to set all of the flavours in the hot dish. The rice will finish off cooking while resting.
_While chicken is resting, prepare mushrooms:_
6. Heat butter in a pan over medium-high heat. Sauté garlic until fragrant (30 seconds) and add mushrooms; cook until softened. Stir in 2 tablespoons of chives and season with salt and pepper.
7. Transfer chicken onto a plate; fluff rice with forks, then mix the mushrooms through the rice. Arrange chicken back onto the rice in the dish, garnish with remaining chives and chopped parsley. SERVE and enjoy!
