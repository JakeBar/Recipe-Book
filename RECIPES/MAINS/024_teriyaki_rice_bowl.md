## Steps

Drain the brown rice from the soaking liquid and add into a pot or stovetop rice cooker along with the rinsed white rice and enough cold water to come above the level of the rice by 1.5cm (approximately 2 1/2 -3 cups of water). Bring to a simmer over a high heat uncovered then turn the heat down to low, cover with a tight fitting lid and let the rice simmer gently for around 8-10 minutes. Turn off the heat and keep the rice covered. Allow to steam in the pot for 15 minutes. Drizzle over the sesame oil and mix with a rice paddle or wooden spoon to gently combine.

For the pickled carrots, place the carrots in a heatproof bowl or container. Combine the remaining ingredients in a small pot and bring to a simmer over a medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Simmer for 3-4 minutes or until reduced slightly. Pour over the carrots and set aside to cool. Once these are cool they are ready to use and any excess can be kept in a container in the refrigerator for up to a week.

Season the chicken with a little sea salt and let sit at room temperature while you make the teriyaki glaze. Combine the soy, mirin, sake, garlic, ginger and sugar in a bowl and stir to combine. Set aside.

For the salad, combine the cabbage, spring onions, radishes, shallot and sesame seeds in a large bowl. Whisk the olive oil, vinegar and soy sauce in a small bowl and set aside.

Heat a large fry pan over a high heat and pour in the vegetable oil. Cook the chicken thighs skin side down for around 4 minutes or until golden. Turn the chicken thighs and cook for another 2 minutes. At this stage, the chicken should be almost cooked but still a little under. Pour the teriyaki glaze in and around the chicken and reduce the heat to medium. Cook the chicken for a further two minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked through and the sauce has thickened. I like to turn the chicken a few times in the sauce as it is cooking, so it gets nicely coated with that sauce. Allow to rest for a few minutes then slice the chicken thighs into pieces.

Now to assemble, divide the rice amongst four bowls and arrange some chicken and any teriyaki glaze from the pan into each bowl. Dress the salad with the dressing and place a mound of cabbage salad, some pickled carrots and half of a soft boiled egg on top of the rice. Top with extra roasted sesame seeds and spring onions and serve.
