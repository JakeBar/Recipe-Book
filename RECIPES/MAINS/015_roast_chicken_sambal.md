# Roast Chicken with Sambal

4 servings. Takes about an hour and a half.

## Ingredients

### Chicken
- 1 roast chicken
- 2tsbp olive oil
- Loads of black pepper
- 2 tsp flaked salt

### Sambal
- 4 red chillies
- 150g cherry tomatoes
- 10g fresh turmeric (or double the ginger)
- 10g fresh ginger
- 3 garlic cloves
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp maple syrup
- 2 tsp green or black peppercorns
- 120g onion
- 20ml lime juice
- 1 tsp flaked salt
- 4 tbsp coconut oil (or sunflower oil)
- 5 makrut lime leaves (or substitute with 5 strips of lime skin)

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 230C.
2. You'll need to spatch-cock a chicken. Using pair of kitchen scissors, find the chicken's backbone and cut about an inch either side of it all the way through. Press down on the chicken's wing to flatten out the chicken. Wipe the chicken skin down with a paper towel and leave out on the bench for an hour. It's safe, I promise.

> Note: Don't throw away this piece. You can use this and the chicken carcus later for a stock.

3. Combine all the ingredients for the sambal except the coconut oil and kaffir lime leaves. Blitz it with a blender.
4. Heat a frying pan with coconut oil. Stir fry the kaffir lime leaves until fragrant.
5. Pour the blended mixture into the frying pan and stir for 2 minutes. Set aside.
6. Rub the chicken with the olive oil, flaked salt and loads of black pepper. Add salt beneath the chicken and inside the cavity too.
7. Place the chicken on tray with baking paper and cook for 40 minutes.
8. Serve with greens or another side dish.
