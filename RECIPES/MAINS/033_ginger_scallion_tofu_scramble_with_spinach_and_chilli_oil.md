# Ginger-Scallion Tofu Scramble With Spinach and Chili Oil

Serves 4. 

## Ingredients

- 900g packages silken tofu, preferably firm silken tofu
- 4 scallions
- 1 12cm piece ginger
- 4 garlic cloves
- 2 Tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. light soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. mirin
- 1 Tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. toasted or untoasted sesame oil
- 2 tsp. ground cumin
- 1 tsp. ground turmeric
- ¼ tsp. kosher salt, plus more
- ¼ tsp. coarsely ground black pepper, plus more
- 4 Tbsp. plant-based butter or unsalted butter
- 200g baby spinach
- ¼ cup store-bought or homemade fried shallots
Chili oil (such as Lee Kum Kee Chiu Chow; for serving)
- 4 slices sourdough bread, toasted

## Steps

1. Line a rimmed baking sheet with several layers of paper towels or a lint-free kitchen towel. Carefully remove 900g silken tofu, preferably firm silken tofu, from packaging and drain as much liquid away as possible. Place tofu on prepared baking sheet and cover with several more layers of paper towels. Gently pat (don’t press; it will collapse) the tofu all over with your hands. You may need to repeat with more paper towels until it is dry. Let sit 5 minutes.

2. Trim 4 scallions and finely slice on a diagonal. Set 2 Tbsp. aside for serving.

3. Scrape skin from one 12cm piece ginger (yes, it's a lot!) with a spoon. Slice off any exposed woody bits. Grate ginger and 4 garlic cloves on the small (shredding) holes of a box grater, then run your knife through them a couple of times to ensure no larger bits remain. (You can also use a Microplane, but a box grater is faster for this volume of aromatics.).

4. Mix 2 Tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. light soy sauce, 1 Tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. mirin, 1 Tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. toasted or untoasted sesame oil, 2 tsp. ground cumin, 1 tsp. ground turmeric, ¼ tsp. kosher salt, and ¼ tsp. coarsely ground black pepper in a small bowl.

5. Heat 4 Tbsp. plant-based butter or unsalted butter in a wok or large skillet over high. As soon as butter is foaming, add scallions, ginger, and garlic and cook, stirring constantly to keep from sticking, until ginger and garlic begin to soften and scallions are wilted and slightly darkened in color, about 2 minutes.

6. Pour soy sauce mixture into pan and cook, stirring, until sauce is reduced by half, about 1 minute.

7. Add 200g baby spinach (about 8 cups) a handful at a time, letting each batch wilt slightly before adding more if needed, then cook, stirring, until all of the greens have wilted a bit, about 2 minutes.

8. Place tofu in pan, gently breaking apart into 1" pieces, and cook, stirring gently with a wooden spoon or heatproof rubber spatula to incorporate, until warmed through and coated in sauce, about 3 minutes. (You want to be gentle when stirring the silken tofu; otherwise, it will break into smaller and smaller pieces. The larger the pieces, the more the texture will emulate that of scrambled eggs.) Taste and season scramble with more salt and pepper if needed.

9. Divide scramble among plates. Top with fried shallots and reserved scallions, dividing evenly, and drizzle with chili oil to taste. Serve with toast alongside.
