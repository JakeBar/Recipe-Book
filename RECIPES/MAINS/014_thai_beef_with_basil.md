# Thai Beef with Basil

4 servings. Takes about half an hour.

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp vegetable oil, divided
- 6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 2 red chillies, thinly sliced, seeded for less heat if desired, divided
- 500g ground beef
- salt
- pepper
- ½ cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 3 cups fresh basil leaves, divided
- 2 medium carrots, coarsely grated
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced
- 4 tbsp fresh lime juice, divided
- 2 tbsp reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 1 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tbsp sugar
- Steamed rice and lime wedges (for serving)

## Steps

1. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add garlic and 1 chile and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add beef, season with salt and pepper, and cook, breaking up with a spoon and pressing down firmly to help brown, until cooked through and nicely crisped in spots, 8–10 minutes. Add broth and 2 cups basil and cook, stirring, until basil is wilted, about 2 minutes.
2. Toss carrots, scallions, 1 Tbsp. lime juice, and remaining chile, 1 cup basil leaves, and 1 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl.
3. Mix soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, and remaining 3 Tbsp. lime juice in another small bowl until sugar dissolves.
4. Top rice with beef and slaw and drizzle with soy dressing. Serve lime wedges alongside for squeezing over.
