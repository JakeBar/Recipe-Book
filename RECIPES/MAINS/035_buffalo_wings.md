# Crispy Oven Baked Buffalo Wings

Serves 6.

## Ingredients

### Crispy Baked Wings
- 2kg chicken wings, cut into wingettes & drumettes
- 5 teaspoons baking powder (NOT baking soda / bi-carb soda)
- 3/4 teaspoons salt

### Sauce
- 4 tbsp (60g) unsalted butter, melted
- 1/2 cup Frank’s Original Red Hot Sauce, or something similar
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 1/4 tsp salt

### Blue Cheese Dip
- 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese, softened (I use gorgonzola)
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1 clove small garlic, minced
- 1 - 3 tbsp milk
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Black pepper

### To Serve
- Celery sticks, optional
- Lots of beer!

## Steps

### Crispy Baked Wings

1. If you plan ahead, lay the wings on a rack on a rimmed baking tray and let them dry uncovered in the fridge overnight. Alternatively, pat them dry with paper towels.
2. Preheat the oven to 120°C (all oven types). Put one oven shelf in the lower quarter of the oven and one in the top quarter.
3. Line the tray with foil. Spray the rack on the baking tray with oil.
4. Place the wings in a large bowl. Sprinkle over baking powder and salt. Use hands to toss well (or shake in ziplock bag) to coat wings evenly.
5. Place the wings skin side up on the rack (ok if snug, they shrink). Bake on the lower shelf in the oven for 30 minutes.
6. Then move the tray up to the higher shelf and turn the oven up to 220°C. Bake for a further 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the tray halfway through. The wings do not need to be turned over.
7. The wings are ready when they are dark golden brown and the skin is very crispy.
8. Toss with Hot Sauce and serve immediately with Blue Cheese Dip and celery sticks. They can be served plain, with a dipping sauce or tossed in sauce. Wings also reheat crispy!

### Sauce

1. Whisk together the Sauce ingredients. Keep warm or reheat just prior to using.

### Blue Cheese Dip

1. Mash the blue cheese with sour cream until smooth (or to your taste).
2. Add remaining ingredients and mix well until combined, using milk to get it to the consistency you want.
3. Store in the fridge until required. Remove from the fridge 15 minutes before serving.
