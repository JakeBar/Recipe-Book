# Miso Salmon

Rather than cook plain old salmon, why not try a japanese style instead? 🐟🐟🐟

## Ingredients

### Meat
- Salmon skin-on

### Marinade
- 2 Tbsp white miso* (White Miso or Awase Miso (mix of white & red miso) are recommended for this recipe)
- 1 Tbsp sake
- 1 Tbsp mirin
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- ¼ tsp sesame oil (roasted)

### Other
- Green Beans (to serve)
- Rice (to serve)

## Steps

1. Mix all the ingredients for the marinade in a large bowl.
2. Place the salmon in the bowl, skin side up. Spoon marinade and coat the salmon skin. If you have time, cover and keep in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
3. Put on a hot pan on medium-high heat. Sear the salmon (skin side first) on both sides quickly, no more than 30 seconds.
> _Note: Miso burns super easily, so make sure not to leave the salmon in the pan for too long_
4. Transfer the salmon to a baking tray and cook in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes.
5. Serve with Green beans on a small bed of rice.
