## Ingredients

### Dan Dan Sauce

- 1.5 tbsp Chinese chilli paste in oil, from your local asian grocer
- 4 tbsp light soy sauce
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 3 tsp white sugar
- 1/2 tsp Chinese five spice powder (Can be made from scratch, Google it)
- 1 tsp Sichuan pepper powder, preferably freshly ground
- 3 tbsp (or more!) chilli oil, from your local asian grocer
- 3/4 cup (185ml) chicken broth/stock, hot, low sodium

### Pork topping
- 2 tsp Hoisin sauce
- 1 tsp dark soy sauce (Note 7)
- 1 tbsp Chinese cooking wine (sub 2 tbsp extra chicken stock)
- 1/2 tsp Chinese five spice powder (Can be made from scratch, Google it)
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 250g pork mince (ground pork)

### To serve
- 500g white fresh noodles, medium thickness (Note 9)
- Preserved mustard greens, from your local asian grocer
- 2 green onions, finely sliced
- 1 tbsp peanuts, finely chopped (optional)

## Steps

### Dan Dan Sauce:
Mix all ingredients except oil and chicken stock. Then gently stir in oil and stock - oil should be sitting on surface. Set aside.

### Pork:
Mix together hoisin, soy, Chinese wine and five spice ("Sauce").
Heat oil in a skillet or wok over high heat. Add pork and cook, breaking it up as you, until it changes from pink to white. Add Sauce and cook for 1 minute, then transfer into a bowl.

### Noodles:
Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Cook noodles per packet directions.
Drain.

### Assemble:
Ladle 1/4 of Dan Dan Sauce into a bowl. Pile in noodles, top with pork and Sui mi ya cai. Optionally serve with asian greens on the side.
Sprinkle with peanuts and green onions and serve.
To eat, mix it all up to coat the noodles well with Sauce, then devour!
