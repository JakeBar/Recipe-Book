# Lamb Kefta with Smoked Eggplant and Almonds

This recipe is a little bit ambiguous but really yum if you can pull it off ðŸ™Œ

Serves 4-6.

## Ingredients

### Kefta
- 600g lamb mince
- 10g coriander powder
- 10g flaked salt
- 10g chopped parsley
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed

### Sauce
- 30g butter
- Olive oil
- 200g dry chickpeas, soaked and cooked
- 200g pearl couscous, blanched
- 1 tsp Red Aleppo pepper or paprika
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 2L lamb or vegetable stock
- Â½ bunch silverbeet
- 2 eggplants, chargrilled and peeled Â½ bunch cavolo nero (black cabbage) or kale
- Lemon juice to taste
- Salt to taste

### Dressing
- 30g slivered or roughly chopped almonds
- 30g pomegranate seeds
- 5 sprigs parsley leaves, finely sliced
- 4 sprigs coriander leaves, finely sliced
- 100ml olive oil

## Steps

1. Place ingredients for kefta in a medium-sized bowl. Mix very well for 3â€“4 minutes. Roll into small balls and rest for at least 20 minutes.

2. Heat a medium-sized pot and sear the kefta until golden brown on all sides. Set aside for later. Place same pot back on heat, add the butter and a drizzle of olive oil. Saute the chickpeas, couscous, spices and salt for 1â€“2 minutes.

3. Put lamb back in pan. Add the stock and bring to boil. Simmer for 5 minutes or until stock has reduced by half. Add silverbeet, eggplant, cavolo nero and season with salt and lemon juice to taste. Place into serving dish and dress with almonds, pomegranate seeds, herbs and olive oil.

> Instead of the silverbeet or kale, you can use any greens you come across in the supermarket such as fresh chard, spinach or cabbage.

> The key to this recipe is working the spices into the lamb to get the best flavour. This means getting hands on and massaging it through the meat with your fingers at least 20 minutes before cooking.
