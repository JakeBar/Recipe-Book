# Alec's Poke Bowl

A refreshing dish that's surprisingly easy to make.

Serves loads of peeps.

## Ingredients

- 500 grams thinly sliced Tuna/Salmon from fish market
- Sesame Seeds
- 200 grams podded edamame
- Radish (finely sliced)
- Avocado
- Coriander
- 330 grams sushi rice
- 1/4 cup (60ml) seasoned rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon caster sugar
- Pickled Ginger (to serve)

## Steps

1. Rinse rice under cold water to remove the starch. Drain, then place in a pan with 2 cups (500ml) water and bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stand, without removing the lid, for 10 minutes or until liquid is absorbed and rice is cooked.
2. Meanwhile, combine vinegar, sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir through the rice, then spread out on a tray to cool.
3. Divide rice among bowls and top with edamame, radish, avocado and slices of salmon/tuna. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve with pickled ginger.
