# Soy Chicken with Sprunion sauce

Nice alternative for a regular roast chicken.
Note this is an **overnight** recipe.

## Ingredients

### Chicken

- 1 free range chicken
- 100ml soy sauce
- 80ml honey 
- 2 tsp Chinese five spice
- 1 tsp rice vinegar
- 2 tbsp Shaoxing (rice wine or sherry or just another tbsp soy sauce)
- Thumb sized piece of ginger 

### Spring onion sauce (sprunion sauce)

- Bunch spring onions
- Thumb sized piece of ginger 
- 1 tbsp rice wine
- 50ml sunflower oil
- Salt

## Steps

1. Spatchcock the chicken by cutting down the spine and removing the backbone. Roughly chop the ginger and mix together all the marinade ingredients in a bowl then add in the chicken and turn so that both sides get some loving. Cover and marinade in the fridge overnight. Try to turn once during this time so that both sides absorb equal flavour. 

2. Preheat oven to 230Â°C.

3. Remove chicken from the marinade and pat dry with a bit of kitchen roll. Place onto baking tray. Pour the marinade into a saucepan  and bring to the boil the pass through a sieve. This will get rid of any impurities. Let your chicken air dry in the fridge for up to an hour but no longer.

4. Rub a little olive oil and seasoning onto the bird then place into the oven for 45-50 minutes depending on size. **Do not** open the door during this time. Just allow the oven to work its magic.

5. For the pickled carrot peel the carrots into ribbons and dress in the honey, sesame seeds, coriander, a glug of olive oil and some seasoning. 

6. For the sprunion (spring onion) sauce finely chop the spring onion and ginger and add to a bowl with the rice wine and a pinch of salt. Heat the oil until smoking then pour over the chopped onion and
ginger, it should sizzle away.             

7. Remove the chicken from the oven once fully cooked and place on a chopping board to rest while you finish the sauce. Place the roasting dish on the heat and add 100ml water to deglaze
then add the marinade set aside from earlier. Reduce down until slightly thickened and syrupy.

8. Carve the chicken and serve with rice & asian greens.
