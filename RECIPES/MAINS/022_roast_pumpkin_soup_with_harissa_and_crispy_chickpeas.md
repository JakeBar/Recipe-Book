# Roasted pumpkin soup with harissa and crisp chickpeas

No joke best soup I've ever had ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹

Serves 6.

## Ingredients

- 1 small pumpkin or butternut squash, cut in half, seeds removed, peeled and flesh cut into 2cm dice (600g net weight)
- 90ml olive oil
- Salt and black pepper
- 2-3 banana shallots, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 4 cardamom pods, crushed to release the seeds, outer husks discarded
- 2Â½ tbsp harissa paste
- Â½ tsp rose water
- 1 litre vegetable or chicken stock
- 2 tins chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 7 dried apricots, thinly sliced
- 5g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
- 240g Greek yoghurt

## Steps

Heat the oven to 220C. Mix the pumpkin with two tablespoons of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and some pepper. Spread out on a parchment-lined baking tray and roast for 25 minutes, until golden-brown and cooked through, then set aside.

Put two tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, fry the shallots for seven to eight minutes, stirring a few times, until soft and caramelised. Add half the garlic, half the cumin, all the cardamom seeds, a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Fry for two minutes, then stir in the harissa, rose water, stock, half the chickpeas and the apricots. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer for five minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the pumpkin.

Put two tablespoons of oil in a medium frying pan on a high heat and, once hot, add the remaining chickpeas, garlic and cumin, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and lots of pepper. Fry for seven minutes, stirring occasionally and crushing some of the chickpeas as you go, until browned and crisp.

Warm the soup through and divide between six bowls. Sprinkle with the chickpea mix, scatter over some coriander, spoon over the yoghurt and serve.
