# Beef Chow Fun

This recipe "serves 2" but it's more like 4.
35 minutes prep + cooking time.

## Ingredients

- 160g beef rump or topside, very thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp peanut oil
- 3 thin slices ginger, bruised
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled & minced
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 4 thick spring onions, trimmed, cut into 7cm lengths and sliced vertically
- 500g fresh wide flat rice noodles
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 pinch sugar
- 1 pinch white pepper
- 1 tsbp Shaoxing wine
- 2 cups beansprouts
- chillies in oil, to serve

### Marinade
- 2 tsp dark soy sauce
- 2 tsp Shaoxing wine
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp cornflour

## Steps

1. Mix the meat with the marinade ingredients & set aside for at least 10 minutes.
2. Heat a wok or large saucepan over high heat and add half the oil. Cook the meat until well browned and remove from the pan. Brush out the pan if necessary.
3. Add the remaining oil, the ginger, garlic, salt and spring onions, tossing until fragrant. Add the rice noodles, toss and allow to sit for a minute over heat without tossing, then add the soy sauces, sugar and pepper and pour in the Shaoxing wine around the edges of the wok. Toss for a further minute then add the beef. If the wok looks a little dry you can add some water, stock or oil to moisten. Toss occasionally until the noodles soften, then add the beansprouts and toss until they soften too. Serve with some chillies in oil.
