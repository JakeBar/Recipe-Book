I didn't know you do this to corn ðŸŒ½

Serves 8.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup walnuts
- 1 cup Israeli couscous
- Kosher salt
- 4 ears of corn, husked
- 2 tablespoons plus Â¼ cup olive oil, divided
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 250g Halloumi cheese, sliced lengthwise Â¾-inch thick
- 3 scallions, thinly sliced
- Â½ cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley
- Â¼ cup basil leaves
- Â¼ cup mint leaves
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons (or more) white wine vinegar

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 175Â°C. Toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 8â€“10 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop.

2. Cook Israeli couscous in a large pot of boiling salted water according to package directions. Drain (do not rinse) and spread out on a baking sheet to let cool.

3. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Rub corn with 1 Tbsp. oil; season with salt and pepper. Grill, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and tender, 8â€“10 minutes. Transfer to a platter and let cool.

4. Meanwhile, brush cheese with 1 Tbsp. oil and grill, turning once, until lightly charred in spots, about 5 minutes. Transfer to platter with corn; let cool.

5. Cut kernels from cobs and place in a large bowl. Add scallions, parsley, basil, mint, walnuts, and Israeli couscous. Using your hands, tear Halloumi into bite-size pieces; add to bowl and toss to combine. Add lemon juice, vinegar, and remaining Â¼ cup oil. Toss to coat; season with salt, pepper, and more vinegar, if desired.
