# Fish Tacos

Best fish tacos I've made at home so far. Yields 8-10 servings.

## Ingredients

### Meat
- 2 pounds grenadier (skinned, boned and cleaned) cut into 1-ounce strips
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 eggs, lightly beaten
- 4 tablespoons water
- 2 cups panko bread crumbs
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Vegetable oil, for frying

### Filling
- 2 mangoes, diced
- 1/2 head savoy cabbage, finely shredded
- 1 bunch cilantro, leaves picked
- 1 bunch chives, chopped
- 3 limes, cut into wedges for garnish
- Chilli Mayo siracha

### Tortillas
- Locally sourced corn tortillas

## Steps

1. Prepare the fish. Cut the pieces of fish into 1-ounce strips. Set up a breading station of flour, lightly beaten eggs with water, and seasoned panko bread crumbs. Season all with salt and pepper. Dredge the pieces of fish in flour, egg then bread crumbs. Once all the fish is breaded deep-fry in small batches in (375 degrees F) oil. Drain on paper towels and season with salt. Keep warm until ready to serve.

2. One at a time, toast the corn tortillas in a pan for < 30 seconds each side over high heat. Set aside covered in foil. A good estimate is about 5 tortillas per person.

4. To serve, set up the tacos "family-style" (why the original author of this quotes family-style I'm not sure - Jake). Assemble the fish in a pile on a plate alongside the mayo and diced mango. Set a pile of tortillas, shredded savoy cabbage, cilantro leaves, chopped chives and lime wedges next to the fish.
