# Nasu Dengaku - Miso Glazed Eggplant

Takes about 15 mins. Goes well as a side dish for japanese mains.

## Ingredients

- 2 small eggplant
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil or other neutral oil
- 1/4 cup miso paste (I use awase miso which is a mix of both red and white miso paste)
- 2 tablespoons mirin
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon sake
- sesame seeds

## Steps

Slice eggplant in half and using a knife, score the inside in small squares.

In a pan over high heat, add oil and put the eggplant skin facing down.

Cook for a few minute until skin is brown. Turn the eggplant over and cover with a lid. Cook until eggplant is cooked through (about 3 to 4 minutes).

Meanwhile, in a bowl, mix miso, mirin, sugar and sake.
Cover a cooking tray with foil and place the eggplant on top. Brush miso dengaku mix on top of each eggplant until all the surface is coated.

Put in the oven and broil for 4 minutes. The miso mix should be bubbling when you take it out of the oven.
Sprinkle sesame seeds on top and serve hot.
